#       AREA MODULE MESSAGES (AREA)
# =====================================================

# --- Region Entry/Exit Messages ---
# This key is used as a wrapper for entry and exit messages defined
# directly in the configuration files of each region (e.g., safezone.yml).
# {0} will be replaced by the message configured in the region.
# Example usage in code: player.sendMessage(plugin.getMessage("area.custom-message", region.getEntryMessage()));
custom-message: "{0}"

# --- Admin Command Messages (/areaadmin) ---
admin:
  usage: "&cUsage: /areaadmin <define|delete|list> ..."
  define-placeholder: "&eArea definition command (placeholder)."
  delete-placeholder: "&eArea deletion command (placeholder)."
  list-placeholder: "&eArea list command (placeholder)."

# --- Future Messages (TODOs) ---
# If you add more functionalities to the Area module that need messages,
# add the keys here.
# Ex:
#  pvp-toggle-on: "&aPvP enabled in this area."
#  pvp-toggle-off: "&cPvP disabled in this area."
#  mob-spawn-prevented: "&cVanilla mob spawns have been prevented in this area."
